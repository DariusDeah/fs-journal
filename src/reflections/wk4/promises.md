# Javasscript Promises

## what are the 3 states of promises

- Pending; this is before any result has been given for the promise
- Resolved ; this is when the promise is completed
- Rejected; this is when the promise failed

## How do promises fix callback hell?

By allowing you to attach callbacks instead of passing them with a method called chaining

---

## .then vs .catch

the .then method is ran when the promise is succesful while .catch is ran when the promise is rejected/failed
