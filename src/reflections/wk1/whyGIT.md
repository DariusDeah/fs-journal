# Git

Git is a free source **version control** system that allows multiple **branches** of a project to be tracked

## Why Git

we use git to make sure there are no code conflicts between developers as well as allowing developers to revert back to an earlier version of a project when changes in plans/goals arise

---

## Perks of Multiple Branches

having multiple branches allows a developer test or change a subsection of a project without having there change cause irriversible changes to the _main branch_

---

## Git vs Git-Hub

**Git** is a local repository that holds changes a developer makes while **Git-Hub** is a _remote repository_ where other developers can see and adjust the program
