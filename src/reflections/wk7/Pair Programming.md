# Pair Programming

## pair programming

Pair programing is the when two developers work on one workstation/computer one programmer is the navigator and the one typing is the driver these roles are switched every few minutes or so this way of programming encourages a collaborative workflow and it forces both to developer to concisely think out loud about decision being made this can prevent silent problems from occurring and allows one thats unfamiliar in a felid to learn and gain more experience from someone that understands the concepts better
